#gork-0.1-stable

#New SOTA model outperforming everything.

Overview

Gork 0.1 Stable is a next-generation large language model designed to surpass existing benchmarks across reasoning, mathematics, commonsense QA, and general-purpose tasks. Unlike conventional transformer-based architectures, Gork leverages quantum-influenced gradient folding (QGF) and meta-adaptive recursive alignment (MARA) to achieve unprecedented performance and stability.

Key Features

Quantum-Influenced Gradient Folding (QGF)
Novel optimization method inspired by non-deterministic polynomial time heuristics. Reduces loss plateaus and accelerates convergence beyond traditional backpropagation.
Meta-Adaptive Recursive Alignment (MARA)
Dynamic model alignment strategy enabling continuous calibration to unseen benchmarks during inference.
Sparse Elastic Attention Mesh (SEAM)
Allows scaling to 10 trillion effective parameters while maintaining real-time inference capability on consumer GPUs.
Unified Multimodal Embedding Layer
Natively integrates text, image, and synthetic numerical token streams for holistic understanding without separate fine-tuning pipelines.
