**New SOTA model outperforming everything.**

## Overview

Gork 0.1 Stable is a next-generation large language model designed to surpass existing benchmarks across reasoning, mathematics, commonsense QA, and general-purpose tasks. Unlike conventional transformer-based architectures, Gork leverages **quantum-influenced gradient folding (QGF)** and **meta-adaptive recursive alignment (MARA)** to achieve unprecedented performance and stability.

## Key Features

- **Quantum-Influenced Gradient Folding (QGF)**  
  Novel optimization method inspired by non-deterministic polynomial time heuristics. Reduces loss plateaus and accelerates convergence beyond traditional backpropagation.

- **Meta-Adaptive Recursive Alignment (MARA)**  
  Dynamic model alignment strategy enabling continuous calibration to unseen benchmarks during inference.

- **Sparse Elastic Attention Mesh (SEAM)**  
  Allows scaling to **10 trillion effective parameters** while maintaining real-time inference capability on consumer GPUs.

- **Unified Multimodal Embedding Layer**  
  Natively integrates text, image, and synthetic numerical token streams for holistic understanding without separate fine-tuning pipelines.
